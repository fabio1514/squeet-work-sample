# Squeet app

1. Set up a postgres instance and run the [db creation script](https://github.com/tillson/squeet/blob/master/api/create_db.sql).
2. Run `npm install` on the `api/` folder and run the api server with `yarn start` or a similar entrypoint command
3. Make sure you configure your `config/dev.json` folder to put images in the right place (or card images will fail to load)
